### **Algorithm for Analyzing Blood Donation Intents**

**Step 1: Data Extraction**
1. Load the CSV file containing donor intent data. Retrieve the "Intent" column for analysis.

**Step 2: Semantic Word Filtering**
2. Predefine categories relevant to blood donation:
   - **Social Service:** Words or phrases indicating altruism, community welfare, or helping others.
   - **Health Benefits:** Words or phrases suggesting health awareness, wellness improvement, or benefits derived from donation.

**Step 3: Dynamic Array Creation**
3. Maintain two dynamic arrays:
   - **Social Service Array:** Populate with terms like *help, save lives, humanity, community*.
   - **Health Benefits Array:** Populate with terms like *well-being, health check, fitness*.

**Step 4: Continuous Learning from New CSVs**
4. Process subsequent CSVs to:
   - Use existing arrays for filtering.
   - Identify and add new blood-donation-relevant terms using semantic similarity models (e.g., word embeddings).

**Step 5: Sentiment Analysis and Weight Assignment**
5. For each "Intent" entry:
   - Analyze the moral positivity of the intent (e.g., *wants to help others* is positive).
   - If positive:
     - Identify matches from the **Social Service** and **Health Benefits** arrays.
     - Assign weights:
       - Higher weight for **Social Service** words (*life-saving*, *helping*).
       - Slightly lower weight for **Health Benefits** words (*free check-up*, *staying fit*).

**Step 6: Contextual Analysis**
6. Consider specific phrases or contexts:
   - Combine word matches with overall meaning to ensure alignment with blood donation impact.

**Step 7: Scoring**
7. Calculate a score for each donor:
   - Sum weights of matched words.
   - Factor in positivity of intent and relevance to blood donation.

**Step 8: Update and Store Data**
8. Add a new column, "Impact Score," in the CSV to store computed scores.

**Step 9: Iterative Enhancement**
9. Process additional donor data to:
   - Refine arrays with new socially impactful and health-related words.
   - Ensure adaptability across diverse blood donation contexts.

### **Use Case-Specific Features**
- **Proximity to Blood Donation Centers:** Incorporate geospatial analysis to prioritize donors closer to donation sites.
- **Donation History Weighting:** Adjust scores based on prior donation behavior.
- **Motivation Analysis:** Identify highly motivated individuals through detailed intent parsing (e.g., analyzing phrases like *donating blood to save lives*).

### **Patentable Edge**
- Integration of intent analysis with domain-specific features like donation history and geospatial proximity.
- Continuous refinement of arrays across diverse datasets to dynamically adapt to new donor motivations and trends.
